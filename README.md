🚀  Personality-Prediction-using-ML

📌 Overview

This project focuses on Personality Prediction using Machine Learning leverages text data and psychological trait analysis to classify individuals’ personalities. This project applies NLP techniques and ML models (like Random Forest and XG Boost to predict traits, enabling insights for HR, marketing, and personal development.

It demonstrates practical implementation of data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization to solve real-world challenges.

✨ Features
